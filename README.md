# NIFTY-50 Stock Market Predictor ðŸ“ˆ

An end-to-end, modular Python app for interactive stock-price prediction on NIFTY-50 equities.  The UI is powered by **Streamlit** and lets a user:

1. Pick any company from the NIFTY-50 list (auto-updated from Yahoo Finance tickers).
2. Configure hyper-parameters and choose among multiple prediction models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, Random-Forest*)
3. Visualise historical prices as well as model forecasts, error metrics and side-by-side model comparisons.

> *Random-Forest & LSTM demos are provided as optional advanced notebooks â€“ Prophet & ARIMA are fully wired in the Streamlit front-end.*

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The first run will download price histories via Yahoo Finance; subsequent runs are cached.
